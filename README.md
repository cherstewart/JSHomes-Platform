# The Platform for JSHomes.org

JSHomes.org is the website that's Fighting Poverty with Code http://bit.ly/jshomes

The JSHomes Platform is the courseware / CMS software that we're building JSHomes.org on.


## What is JSHomes?

JSHomes is a not-for-profit organization established in order to provide tech education resources to the homeless services community. We work primarily with housing-first programs to help recently housed individuals learn to code in order to find programming jobs. We also aim to raise awareness of the challenges faced by the homeless and solutions that have been proven to work. For more information, please read [The Cure for Homelessness](https://medium.com/end-homelessness/the-cure-for-homelessness-83ef0d621c71).

### Open Source at JSHomes

JSHomes relies on a lot of open source technology. Contributing to any of these projects will help us to build a better platform for users in all of the training centers.

Our courses and documentation are produced using Markdown. Our content management is currently handled with WordPress. Our custom feature work is done with JavaScript, [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node), and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).
